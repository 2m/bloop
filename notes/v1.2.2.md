## Highlights :books:

`v1.2.2` is a bugfix release.

### Use `bloop server` via `launchd` in macOS

The launcher executed by brew services was not using `bloop server` but
`blp-server` directly. This was an oversight that is now fixed in v1.2.2,
together with some more changes to ensure that `bloop server` picks up
correctly jvm options specified in `$BLOOP_INSTALLATION_DIR/.jvmopts`. In macOS
systems, the bloop installation directory is the cellar installation directory
for bloop, usually symlinked from `/usr/local/bin/bloop`.
