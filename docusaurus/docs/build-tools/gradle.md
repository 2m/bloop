Gradle 4.8.x uses a three years old version of Zinc (Scala's incremental compiler) which [misses out
on a lot of improvements with regards to performance and correctness in
1.x](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/11/03/zinc-blog-1.0.html). Installing bloop makes a big
difference in Gradle builds.

## Export the build

Install and learn how to export the build in the Installation Guide:
