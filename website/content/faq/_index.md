## What is Bloop?

Bloop is a command line tool that aims at accelerating edit-compile-test workflows for Scala
developers. Bloop doesn't replace your build tool. Instead, Bloop takes care of the tasks that you
execute the most, performs them fast, and lets your usual build tool do the rest (such as dependency
resolution, publishing, etc.)
