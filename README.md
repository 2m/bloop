Bloop is a Scala command-line tool and build server developed at the Scala
Center to make the compile and test feedback loop as tight as possible. This
means a faster and more productive developer workflow.

### Tigth feedback loop

Edit, compile and test workflows are the bread and butter of our daily jobs.
When our build is slow to respond, our productivity drops. Bloop is a
command-line tool and build server that brings you a tighter developer
workflow. Slow Scala compile times can often be attributed to the slugishness
of our build tool, and `bloop` aims to address them.

We have created bloop to make you productive without getting in your way. We
focus on how you can be faster at writing Scala code using your current build
tool, whether itâ€™s sbt, Maven or Gradle.
